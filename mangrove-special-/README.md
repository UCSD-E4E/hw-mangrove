### GPS Project Abstract

### Canopy Height Estimation Abstract

Mangroves are an important part of our environment as they contribute to sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, sheltering the coast from destructive waves, and providing habitats for delicate ecosystems. To aid in the conservation of mangrove forests, biomass measurements can provide valuable information directly related to the estimated economic and environmental impact of the forest. Although canopy height is one essential variable in calculating the biomass of mangroves, existing height measurement methods fail to report precise results and are often obtained from prohibitively expensive equipment. We present a method of obtaining accurate canopy height measurements using low-cost and low-power sensors to make the calculation of mangrove forest biomass more accurate and accessible.
